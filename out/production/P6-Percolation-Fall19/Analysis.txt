1. Doubling the grid size increases the run time exponentially. It seems to be increasing in O(n^2) time, which
makes sense given that when you double the size you are quadrupling the number of total grids, because 2^2 = 4.
(size = 5 yields 25 grids, while size = 10 yields 100 grids. Tripling size would yield 3^2 * (size ^ 3) grids.

2. doubling the total number of trials doubles the run time.

3. There are 86400 seconds in 24 hours. Given that 800 grids with 20 trials yields a runtime of approximately 5 seconds,
and doubling the number of grids multiplies the runtime by 4, we could double 3200 a little less than 5 more times before we have
a runtime exceeding 86400 seconds
